# javaScript-Dashboard-Chrome-extention-
This project is made with JavaScript, Html, and Css for the purpose of practising and deploying to my local chrome extensions for future use.
In this project data is fetched from different API's and displayed on the web. Bitcoin data and current location weather is fetched from the 
respective API but the time is displayed with only JavaScript built-in method.
